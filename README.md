# DOM Manipulation with Forms

+ This HTML document represents a form and table example with Bootstrap styling. The form includes fields for capturing personal information such as first name, last name, email, address, pincode, gender, choice of food, state, and country. 
  
+ Each input field has a placeholder attribute providing instructions or descriptions for user input. Upon submission of the form, the data is dynamically added to a table below the form. 
  
+ The table displays the submitted data with columns corresponding to the form fields. The layout and responsiveness of the form and table are ensured through the use of Bootstrap classes. 
  
+ Additionally, JavaScript is included to handle form submission, data processing, and table population.
